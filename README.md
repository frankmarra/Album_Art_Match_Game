## Description:

#### The Album Art Match Game is a new take on an old idea. You, the player, are presented with a grid of boxes each containing a music related symbol. Your goal is to find the pairs of boxes containing the same symbols. This will result in the boxes being cleared from the board, and revealing part of an album cover. Clear all of the boxes to see the full album art! Be wary, though, as you will only have three incorrect guesses until the game is over!

#### Before you begin to play, you will be given the option to either search for a specific playlist, or choose from the top ten most currently played playlists. These playlists will determine what album artwork is shown during the game. Who knows, maybe you will find an album cover that strikes your fancy and you decide to check out some new music, too!

## Getting Started:

#### The first thing you will have to do is decide which playlist you would like to play from. We have provided the top ten currently most played lists, or you can use the search bar to search for any playlist you would like. Once you decide on the playlist, you can hit the "Lets Play!" button to be taken to the game page.

#### Once on the game page, you will be able to start clicking on boxes to find matches. You will only be allowed to click on two boxes at a time. If the two boxes you selected are a match, they will be removed from the board. However, if the two boxes do not match, you are given a strike. Just like the old saying goes, "Three strikes, and you're out!" Three strikes will cause the game to end. You will then be able to either play again from the same playlist, or go back to the playlist selection screen to choose a new list to play from.

#### If you clear the board before using all of your strikes, Congratulations! You have won the game! You can now choose to play again, or go back to the playlist selection screen to choose a new list to play from.

#### More features will be added to the game as time allows. Some future implementations include:

- Player score counter
  - Allow player to gain points for correct matches.
  - Instead of game ending if player matches all boxes, player will be able to play another game to bolster their score. This will go on until all strikes are used.
- Added questions
  - Player will be able to guess the album name, artist, and release year for extra points.
  - Wrong answers will incur a strike.
- Add a player timer
  - This will track your time and give you extra points based on how quickly you solve the puzzle.
- And more!

#### I hope you enjoy playing this game, and maybe even finding some new music to listen to!
