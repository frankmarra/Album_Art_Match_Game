## Description:

#### Record Reveal is a new take on an old idea. You, the player, are presented with a grid of boxes each containing a music related symbol. Your goal is to find the pairs of boxes containing the same symbols. This will result in the boxes being cleared from the board, and revealing part of an album cover. Clear all of the boxes to see the full album art!

#### The game pulls in 80 album covers, 20 each from some of my favorite labels, to play with. At the current moment, these albums are pulled from the Discogs API. A future update will include more curated collections to choose from, as these are just 20 random covers from each of the 4 labels that are being used. Fork, clone, open, and enjoy!

## Getting Started:

#### After reading the instructions on the "Info page, either click the link that says "click here to play", or click on the "Game" link in the nav bar.

#### This will take you to the game screen, where all you have to do is click the "Let's Play!" button and start matching. After clearing all of the boxes, the album artist and title will be displayed with the full artwork. You can also now click on the "Next Album" button to play again. Thats all for now.

#### More features will be added to the game as time allows. Some future implementations include:

- Player score tracking
  - Players will get points for each correct guess, and lose points for each wrong guess.
  - The app will also track how many tries it takes to clear the board.
  - On the "Info" page, your top 5 scores will be displayed
- Add a player timer
  - This will track your time and give you extra points based on how quickly you solve the puzzle.
- And more!

#### I hope you enjoy playing this game, and maybe even finding some new music to listen to!
