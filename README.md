## Description:

#### Record Reveal is a new take on an old idea. You, the player, are presented with a grid of boxes each containing a music related symbol. Your goal is to find the pairs of boxes containing the same symbols. This will result in the boxes being cleared from the board, and revealing part of an album cover. Clear all of the boxes to see the full album art! Be wary, though, as you will only have six incorrect guesses until the game is over!

#### The album covers will all be from a genre that you choose on the search Page. When you search, you will also have a chance to see the album covers you will be playing with.

#### To get started, click on the "Search" link in the top right of the screen. This will bring you to the search page. Type in a genre, and then click on the "Game" link. Then all thats left is to hit "Let's Play!". Try and get a high score, and have fun!

## Getting Started:

#### To begin the game, click on the "Let's Play!" button. Begin trying to match boxes until you match them all, or make six wrong guesses. You will be given 10 points for a correct guess.

#### If you would like to search for a new genre of album covers to play with, go to the search page, enter a genre, and hit the search button. Take a look at the album covers. If they look good, all you have to do is go back to the game page and hit "Let's Play!".

#### More features will be added to the game as time allows. Some future implementations include:

- Player Hi-Score
  - Instead of game ending if player matches all boxes, player will be able to play another game to bolster their score. This will go on until all strikes are used.
- Add a player timer
  - This will track your time and give you extra points based on how quickly you solve the puzzle.
- And more!

#### I hope you enjoy playing this game, and maybe even finding some new music to listen to!
