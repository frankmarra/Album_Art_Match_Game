      <p>Record Reveal is a new take on an old idea. The player is presented with a grid of boxes each containing a music related symbol. Your goal is to find the pairs of boxes containing the same symbols. This will result in the boxes being cleared from the board, and revealing part of an album cover. Clear all of the boxes to see the full album art! Be wary, though, as you will only have six incorrect guesses until the game is over!</p>
